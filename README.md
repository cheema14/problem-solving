# problem-solving 
<p>We all feel extremely good when we find a solution for a problem. <br> 
Well.. in this repository you aren't going to find solutions for the life problems :P You can find it within yourself ;) <br></p>
<p>This repo contains solutions to mostly asked interview questions. The problems are mostly taken from
1. Leetcode
2. Daily coding problem
3. Codility <br>
& <br>
4. those nerd colleagues of mine who have experienced problems during interviews. Either they failed to solve it or they challenge you to find a solution for it :)
